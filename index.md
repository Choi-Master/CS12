# CS 12, Fall 2024


Due dates, marks, discussions, etc. are all on MS TEAMS.

Also, I recommend you use [the Mu Python editor](https://codewith.mu/) to run your
Python programs. It's easy to use, and comes complete with all the libraries
you'll need for this course. However, you may use other editors like the built-in Python IDLE or Microsoft VS Code.

## Lecture Notes (Fall 2024)

Most of the notes are written in [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). [See
here for an
overview](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AllenDowney/ThinkPython/blob/v3/chapters/jupyter_intro.ipynb)
if you are unfamiliar with notebooks.

**You don't need to install notebook software on your computer**. They are
easy to read on the web in a couple of ways:

1. Directly through my github web links. Just click on the Github link, e.g.
   [chapter 0](https://github.com/Choi-Master/CS12/blob/gh-pages/textbook/chap00.ipynb)
2. Using the [Jupyter notebook viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Paste the
   github link into the viewer.
3. You can also download and read the files in Microsoft Visual Studio (VS) Code.
